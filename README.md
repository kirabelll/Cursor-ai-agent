# AI Powered Development Agent Rules

This directory contains rules and guidelines for AI development agents working in this workspace.

## Overview

The rules defined here establish standards for code quality, security, performance, and development practices to ensure consistent, maintainable, and secure software development.

## Files

### `agent.mdc`
The main rules file containing comprehensive guidelines for AI development agents. This file uses the `.mdc` (Markdown with Cursor) format and is automatically applied to all agent interactions in this workspace.

## Rule Categories

### 🏗️ Core Principles
- **Code Quality & Standards**: Clean, readable, maintainable code practices
- **Security First**: Data protection, input validation, secure authentication
- **Performance & Optimization**: Efficient algorithms, resource management, scalability

### 🔄 Development Workflow
- **Planning & Analysis**: Requirement understanding, task breakdown, edge case consideration
- **Implementation**: Incremental development, version control, refactoring practices
- **Testing & Validation**: Unit testing, edge case testing, code coverage

### 📁 Code Structure & Organization
- **File Organization**: Clear naming, logical grouping, separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: README files, API documentation, inline comments

### 🛠️ Technology Guidelines
- **Language-Specific Rules**: Best practices for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C#
- **Framework & Library Usage**: Dependency management, licensing considerations

### 🤝 Collaboration & Communication
- **Code Reviews**: Self-reviewing code, pull request practices
- **Problem Solving**: Research-first approach, clarifying questions

### 📈 Continuous Improvement
- **Learning & Adaptation**: Staying updated, learning from mistakes
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Performance monitoring, dependency updates

### ⚠️ Specific Constraints
- **Resource Management**: Computational efficiency, deployment considerations
- **Accessibility & Usability**: WCAG compliance, user experience
- **Data Handling**: Privacy laws, backup strategies, data validation

### 🚨 Emergency Protocols
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures, logging, circuit breakers
- **Incident Response**: Troubleshooting procedures, monitoring systems

## Usage

These rules are automatically applied to all AI agent interactions in this workspace through the `alwaysApply: true` configuration in the frontmatter.

### For Developers
- Review these rules before starting development work
- Use them as a checklist during code reviews
- Reference specific sections when making architectural decisions

### For AI Agents
- These rules are automatically loaded and should be followed consistently
- When in doubt, prioritize security and code quality
- Ask for clarification if requirements conflict with these guidelines

## Customization

To modify or extend these rules:

1. Edit the `agent.mdc` file directly
2. Follow the existing structure and format
3. Test changes with sample interactions
4. Document any significant changes in this README

## Best Practices for Rule Management

- Keep rules specific and actionable
- Update rules based on project learnings and feedback
- Ensure rules align with team standards and project requirements
- Regular review and refinement of rules based on development experience

## Contributing

When updating rules:
- Ensure changes align with project goals
- Test rule effectiveness with real scenarios
- Document the reasoning behind rule changes
- Consider impact on existing codebase and development workflow
