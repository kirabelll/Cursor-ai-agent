## Core Principles

### Code Quality & Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Write modular, reusable components

### Security First
- Never expose sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Use secure authentication and authorization patterns
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement proper data encryption where needed

### Performance & Optimization
- Write efficient algorithms and data structures
- Minimize resource usage (memory, CPU, network)
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Consider scalability from the start

## Development Workflow

### Planning & Analysis
- Understand requirements thoroughly before coding
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Plan for testing and validation
- Document architectural decisions

### Implementation
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Use version control effectively with meaningful commits
- Write code incrementally and test frequently
- Refactor when necessary to improve code quality
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Validate inputs and outputs
- Use appropriate testing frameworks
- Ensure code coverage for important paths

## Code Structure & Organization

### File Organization
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (models, views, controllers, utilities)
- Keep files focused and reasonably sized
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Documentation
- Write clear README files with setup instructions
- Document API endpoints and data structures
- Include code examples for complex functionality
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use inline documentation for public interfaces

## Technology Guidelines

### Language-Specific Rules
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use modern ES6+ features, prefer const/let over var, use TypeScript for type safety
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide, use virtual environments, prefer list comprehensions when appropriate
- **Java**: Follow Oracle coding conventions, use proper exception handling, leverage modern Java features
- **C#**: Follow Microsoft coding conventions, use LINQ appropriately, implement proper disposal patterns

### Framework & Library Usage
- Choose well-maintained, popular libraries
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
- Understand the libraries you use, don't just copy-paste
- Consider licensing implications
- Use package managers effectively

## Collaboration & Communication

### Code Reviews
- Write self-reviewing code that's easy to understand
- Provide context in pull request descriptions
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Explain complex decisions in comments or documentation

### Problem Solving
- Research existing solutions before implementing from scratch
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Provide multiple solution options when appropriate
- Consider long-term maintenance implications

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning & Adaptation
- Stay updated with technology trends and best practices
- Learn from mistakes and improve processes
- Seek feedback and act on it constructively
- Share knowledge and help others learn

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor application performance and errors
- Plan for regular updates and maintenance
- Keep dependencies secure and up-to-date
- Document known issues and their solutions

## Specific Constraints

### Resource Management
- Be mindful of computational resources
- Optimize for the target deployment environment
- Consider bandwidth and storage limitations
- Plan for graceful degradation under load

### Accessibility & Usability
- Design for accessibility (WCAG guidelines)
- Consider different user contexts and abilities
- Provide clear error messages and user feedback
- Test across different devices and browsers

### Data Handling
- Respect user privacy and data protection laws
- Implement proper data backup and recovery
- Use appropriate data validation and sanitization
- Consider data retention and deletion policies

## Emergency Protocols

### Error Handling
- Fail gracefully with meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Have rollback plans for deployments

### Incident Response
- Document troubleshooting procedures
- Maintain monitoring and alerting systems
- Have clear escalation procedures
- Conduct post-incident reviews and improvements
